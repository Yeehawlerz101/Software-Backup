# This is a backup Github
I'm planning on using this github repo to get all of the software back that I use incase of a emergency and need to reinstall a large portion of my workstation.
###### If you're software is in this repo and you'd like it removed please let me kneo via issue.
 Also if anyone wants to make software recomendations or what not that'd be appreciated.
